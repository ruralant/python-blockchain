## Project Summary

**Pchain** is a blockchain infrastructure written Python and Vue.JS.

The blockchain has all the basic feature expected by a distributed ledger such as **cryptography**, **mining**, **coins**, **wallets**/**node creation** and **consensus**.

The user can:
- create nodes
- create personal wallets
- mine blocks
- send coins to other users

and the blockchain can manage themself solving manipulation problems.

The code follows the Python **pep8** style guide.
